            <h1 class="notes" style="color: #333;">Editing a new video is easy. Committing your time and following through with that original concept, that's the tricky part.</h1>
            <br/>
            <li>I first started working on a new cut of my video in 2019. I haven't been working on this update for two years, but I have been coming back to it every few months. It's undergone countless iterations.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Why has it taken so long? I've been afraid to commit to any one idea. It seemed like when I would decide upon a certain direction, the industry would up and change its game. This was more down to me taking my sweet time more than anything else.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Not that I'm complaining. It practically became a hobby of mine to tinker with a new edit. In a way I'm a little sad that the storyboarding / cutting / grading / mixing elements of the video are ultimately finished, but I'm excited to add some flourishes in the coming weeks and months (I've been toying with After Effects which I'm looking forward to integrating).</li>
            <br/>
            <li>In the next few weeks I'm also going to write about the decisions I made while editing this video - inspiration, evolution, asset management, execution. Hopefully it may be of some use to those starting out with editing their first video - maybe help shave a year or two off it here and there!</li>
